Create an interactive, dark-themed personal HyperDocument presentation that feels like a cosmic tech experience.

It should be styled like a futuristic digital portfolio with a dark background (space-like or GitHub-style), glowing elements, modern typography, and clean layout. The design should feel immersive, sleek, and professional but also creative.

📌 Main Slide (Dashboard / Home):

    A central circular profile picture (placeholder) with a glowing border

    Around it, clickable floating buttons (or icons styled like planets or nodes) that link to other slides

    Labels on the buttons: "My Journey", "About Me", "My Skills", "Projects", "Hobbies", "Contact Me"

    Use smooth entrance animations like slide-in, fade-in, or orbit-style movements

🪐 My Journey Slide:

    Timeline of important life or academic moments

    Minimalistic glowing dots or steps on a horizontal or vertical path

🎭 About Me Slide:

    Personality traits, values, and personal statement

    A quote or “If you really knew me…” section

🧠 Skills Slide:

    Grid or cards for skills in tech (e.g., Java, Angular, Spring Boot, Docker, etc.)

    Add icons for tech tools and soft skills

💼 Projects Slide:

    Visual gallery or thumbnails of projects

    Each project is clickable → opens a slide with title, description, tools used, and lessons learned

🎧 Hobbies Slide:

    Mood board or aesthetic collage with dark styling

    Embed space for a Spotify playlist, favorite books/movies

📞 Contact Slide:

    Include contact details (LinkedIn, GitHub, email)

    Add clean, modern social media icons

    Option to include a QR code or personal website

✨ Design Style:

    Cosmic dark background (stars, subtle gradients, or deep black)

    Accent colors: neon blue, mint green, white, purple

    Fonts: Orbitron, Roboto, or Montserrat

    Interactive feel with transitions, clickable elements, and glowing hover effects

Make sure the entire document flows like a personal journey through space — engaging, easy to navigate, visually dynamic, and deeply personalized.
